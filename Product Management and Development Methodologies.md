# Product Management and Development Methodologies

## Product Management Key Elements and Phases
- Product vision
    + The needs addressed, problems solve, and the WHY
- Product strategy
    + Plan to achieve product vision and goals
    + Manifested as the roadmap
        * Identify and state needs and alignment with vision
        * Use scenario-based planning
        * Consist of releases
        * Should always be dynamic and fluid, and expectations/communications managed as such
    + Outcome-driven innovation (ODI) and JTBD
        * Customers don't buy products and services; they hire various solutions at various times to get a wide array of jobs done.
        * Investment themes are designed to be addressed on "a percentage of resources to be made available basis." Not in the backlog.
            - Along with epics help with prioritization and determining roadmaps
- Product design and definition
    + UX/UI
    + Information architecture
    + Interaction design
    + Conceptual design
    + Requirements
    + Acceptance criteria
    + Investment/strategic themes
    + Backlog items (aka artifacts)
        * Epics
        * Features
        * User stories
        * Tasks
- Product delivery
    + Design
    + Engineering
    + QA
    + Testing
        * Unit
        * Integration
        * Automation
        * User acceptance (UAT)
        * Usability
            - "Traditional" or "discount" usability testing
            - RITE Method - Rapid Iterative Testing and Evaluation
        * Qualitative and quantitative
        * Agile testing matrix

## Considerations and Tradeoffs
- Iron triangle
    + No silver bullet for magically delivering fixed scope by a fixed date with fixed resources, requires difficult business­based trade­off decisions
- Design by committee (collaboration vs concensus)
    + Godin - "Nothing is what happens when everyone has to agree"
    + Consistently produces weak results

## Product Development Methodologies and Frameworks List (non-exhaustive)
- Agile/SCRUM
    + Alternatives
        * Disciplined agile delivery (DAD)
        * Agile model driven development (AMDD)
- Scaled agile framework (SAFe)
- Kanban
- Scrumban
- Lean
- Outcome-driven innovation (ODI) and 'jobs to be done' (JTBD)
- Waterfall
- Extreme programming (XP)
- Spiral

## Agile Values
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation                    
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

## Agile Manifesto - Principles
- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software.
- Welcome changing requirements, even late in 
development. Agile processes harness change for 
the customer's competitive advantage.
- Deliver working software frequently, from a 
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a 
preference to the shorter timescale.
- Business people and developers must work 
together daily throughout the project.
- Build projects around motivated individuals. 
Give them the environment and support they need, 
and trust them to get the job done.
- The most efficient and effective method of 
conveying information to and within a development 
team is face-to-face conversation.
- Working software is the primary measure of progress.
- Agile processes promote sustainable development. 
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able 
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
- Continuous attention to technical excellence 
and good design enhances agility.
- Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount 
of work not done--is essential.
- The best architectures, requirements, and designs 
emerge from self-organizing teams.
- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how 
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts 
its behavior accordingly.

## Product Development Methodologies (Details)

**Kanban**
- Principles
    + Visualize workflow
    + Create flow and pull
    + Balance demand against throughput
    + Limit WIP
    + Target lead time with performance metric
    + Continuous improvement
    + Class of service
- Benefits
    + Flow-driven, pull system, balance demand and throuput
        + Allows for 'just in time' and more focused delivery of work
        + Less multitasking and context switching
        + Reduces wasted time (parkinsons as well)
    + Not everything requires estimates and deadlines
    + Front-loading not optimimal, and oftern arbitrary
    + Continuous improvement and reprioritization, not fixed methodology
    + More flexible process-wise, quickly adapt to new information and needs
    + Emphasized continous delivery
    + Increased productivity and efficiency
        + Increased output
- Characteristics
    + Class of service (CoD: cost of delay-based)
    + Work in progress (WIP) limits
    + Target date with performance metric

**Lean** 
- Principles
    + Kaizen
    + Build, measure, learn
    + Fail fast and often
    + Maximize customer value while minimizing waste
    + Create flow and establish pull
    + Minimum viable product (MVP)
    + Minimum lovable product (MLP)
    + Minimum marketable feature (MMF)

## Prioritization
- JTBD and importance vs satisfaction (four quadrants) | underserved needs
    + Opportunity (top left)
    + Competitive market (top right)
    + Not worth going after (bottom half)
- Kano model (customer delight vs product function)
    + Categories
        * Must have
        * Performance
        * Delighter
    + Notes
        * Today's must have is tomorrow's delighter
- Pareto: Identify which 20% of features are likely to create 80% of the value/impact
- CoD/CoS: Cost of delay, class of service, and risk
    + CoS
        * Expedite - Unacceptable cost of delay
        * Fixed-date - Step function cost of delay
        * Standard - Linear cost of delay
        * Intangible - Intangible cost of delay
- MoSCoW ­ "MUST, SHOULD, COULD, WON'T"
- Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR) - Value Divided by Effort
- Buy a feature
- KJ method, affinity diagramming/grouping
    + Brainstorm on sticky notes
    + Group items together and name the groups
    + Vote on or rank the groups
- Scorecarding
- Weighted shortest job first (WSJF)
    + Priority = Cost of delay / Job duration
    + Jobs that deliver the highest value (i.e., cost of delay) and can be implemented in the shortest duration are of the highest priority for implementation
- Cost benefit analysis (financial measures)
- Opportunity scoring
- Three feature buckets
- Story mapping and slides
- Pandora method
- Value vs complexity (graph and quadrants)
- Weighted scoring
    + Benefit (positive)
    + Cost (negative)

## Pricing and Service Levels
- Service level agreement (SLA)
    + Mean time between failures (MTBF)
    + Mean time to repair/recovery (MTTR)

## Risk Management
- ROAM model
    - Resolved:­ the risk has been answered and avoided or eliminated
    - Owned: the risk has been allocated to someone who has responsibility for doing something about it
    - Accepted: the risk has been accepted and it has been agreed that
        nothing will be done about it
    - Mitigated:­ action has been taken so the risk has been mitigated,
        either reducing the likelihood or reducing the impact
- Key risks
    - Value risk: would anyone buy this or choose to use it?
    - Usability risk: would they be able to figure out how to use it?
    - Feasibility risk: can our engineers build this with the technology
        available, the time available, and the skill­sets available on the team?
    - Stakeholder risk: are the different parts of the company ok with this proposed solution?
